        The first book to show precisely how genes build the wonders of the human
            brain, and why the Human Genome project could radically alter our view of the world.
            Scientists have struggled to understand how a tiny number of genes could contain the
            instructions for building the human brain, arguably the most complex device in the known
            universe. Synthesizing up-to-the-minute biology with his own original findings on child
            development, Marcus dispels the common misconceptions people harbor about genes, and
            explores the stunning implications of this research for the future of genetic
            engineering.
